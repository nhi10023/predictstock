Predicting Energy Sector Stock Prices in the U.S.
📈 Stock Price Prediction - Energy Sector (U.S.)

This project focuses on predicting stock prices in the U.S. energy sector using LSTM, RNN, and SARIMAX models, and deploying the results through a web application.

📁 Project Setup

1️⃣ Download and Extract Project Files

Download the stockpredict.rar file.

Extract the contents to your preferred directory.

🧑‍💻 Running the Notebooks

Navigate to the extracted folder.

Open the notebooks directory.

Run the following notebooks in order to train and evaluate the models:

LSTM_model.ipynb

RNN_model.ipynb

sarimax_model.ipynb

💡 Ensure that you have all required libraries installed (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras, statsmodels, etc.).

🚀 Launching the Web Application

Go back to the project root directory.

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Run the following command to launch the app:

python app.py

After the server starts, you'll see a link in the terminal output.

Press Ctrl + Click on the link to open the app in your browser.

⚙️ Requirements

Make sure the following libraries are installed before running the project:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

TensorFlow / Keras

statsmodels

Flask (for the web app)

pandas, numpy, matplotlib

You can install all dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

📊 Models Implemented

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)

SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous factors)

💡 Usage

Run models to generate predictions.

Use the web app to visualize and interact with stock price forecasts.
